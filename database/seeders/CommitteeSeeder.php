Dael, ang tanan mga kaparian nga nia diri karon, Members of the Military and the Philippine National Police, ang pinakaguapa nga Bise Mayor sa tibuok kalibutan, ang akong Mises, kanatong tanan, maayong udto akong usbon.To be honest with you, this is my first time to attend the State of the Provice (SOPA). I have attended the State of the Nationa Address (SONA) but SOPA is my firsty time. So, I wasa surprised when I arrived and after reading the program I was surprised that I have a part in the program so, naglibog ko kung unsay akong i-sulti kay nakit-an nako nga naa man diay message sa CWS Party List Representative. So, miingon sa ako si Board Member Conrad C. Cejoco Maayo hinuon na para mubo ra an imo sulti.Before I forget  my respect also to the beautiful wife of my very good friend, my brother in fraternity, Sis, yaon man kaw baya, si Mrs. Lelis C. Pimentel nia dinhi karon, si Hon. Johnny T. Pimentel wala actually because si Johnny is performing his duty sa among fraternity karon tua siya sa Tuguegarao, Isabela. So, mao nga waka siya makalugar pag-anhi.After hearing the report this morning, first from the Vice Governor in his Annual Legislative Accomplosihment Report (ALAR) I was really impressed by the performance of the Members of the Board, akong giihap ang inyong mga Resolutions grabi ka daghan  kadtong inyong gipasa. You have thoroughly discussed this in the Hall of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Many of these I think passess and becomes a Resolution really and approved, di ba?Akong nakita nga you are really working hard and we, Surigaonon is not surchange in voting you and electing you in the last election. If I was impressed by the performance and the report of our Vice Governor I was amazed by the report of our Provincial Governor. Grabi kung pagtan-aw ug pagpaminaw sa iyang report ug akong nakita nga the Governor has realy done his best. In fact, at the end of his report akong nakita that the figure in the government of Surigao del Sur has spent not only for the infrastructure but also for Social Services and other public service. Akong nakita niabot sa  Six Billion (P6,000,000,000.00). I think one (1) term lang ni Governor inspiter of the pandemic. So, akong nakita ang daku kaayo nga improvement sa Surigao del Sur because of a good leadership, mao gyud ni ang atong panginahanglan. Mao kini ang kinahanglan sa Suriago del Sur ang good governance and good leadership ug I think I was very hapy and I was very fortunate that I was in the group of Hugong Surigao whose dedication to servge is heavy and even beyong their own self. So, daku kaayo ang akong pasalamat nga kauban ko kamo because I am also very serious in my part in trying to help Surigao del Sur. In fact, as I promised during election that after my proclamation I will try to invite all my partners in progress, all the leaders of the national agencies involvement in the province for them to discuss with me the proposed programs/activities and projects for 2023. I want to review it because as I have told in many rallies before when we have conducted the survey usa sa mga pangutana nako nga gibutang didto sa survey mao nga kung napili ang Hugpong Surigao unsa nga mga prorama sa  gobyeerno ang inyong gusto dayun mu-abot kaninyo. That is one of the many questions nga atong ipangutana sa survey for us Hugpong to be prepared once we  are already in the position to serve. So, akong nakita ang inyhong gusto. Mao nga akong gipatawag, I requested all the Heads of agencies of national government to come and discuss with me the program. If I found out that the programs that are not  or inconsistent with the needs of Surigao del Sur then I will do my best to change it. Kadtong July 25, right after the SONA is the start of the  discussion of the budget for 2023 and that is why I wanted to prepare myself what kind of projects that maybe brought to Surigao del Sur that is appropriate and needed by us as Surigaonons. So, ako silang gipangutana ug salamat kaayo kanila nga ila pud gihatag ang ilang programa. I have seen some, I  apprpreciate them and I would just dislike others. So, ato kining pagahisgutan later on. In fact, sa agriculture, sa NIA they told me that there is about Six Thousand irrigable area in San Miguel nga hangtud karon wala pa nila  ma-develop, Six Thousand of that irrigable area. So, giingnan ko sila if we can develop even Two Thousand (2,000) hectares a year. I think we can finish that in three (3) years. So, mamo nay among target. Ako silang giingnan give me the proposal and discuss this with your own bosses. The the Department of Public Wroks and Highways (DPWH) I have contacted them and presented to me all their programs and projects and I apprpeciate one. Usa ka proyekto nay taga Lianga diri? Kanang San Pedro paingon didto sa Samilla area. It will passes Samilla area towards Marihatag and even connect San Miguel. Why I like iot because they told  me that Samilla owns about 50,000 hectares of land in that particular municipalities. In fact, Municipality of Marihatag and San Miguel. So, kung ato kini makuha ma-less kini sa mga IPs interested agriculture groups nga mu-fund or mu-finance. I think kaya nat ibutang, dugangan ang employment sa Surigao del Sur. Take for example, 50,000 hecatres, 20,000 of that bwill be developed  into abaca plantation, 20% of that will be developmed into a palm oil plantation then it will add more income to Surigao del Sur. Not only that it will reduce the problem of Peace and Order because that particular road even passess ALCADEV school. Mu-agig ALCADEV. So, kung kaagi-an na amlipay ang military unya sila thay can easily access the areas that are problematic to peace and order. Usa lang kini sa mga projects nga akong na-review pa but . Im doing my best. Wa pa ako magsugod, July 1, 2022 pa. But I want to prepare myself to be ready so that when budget comes I can make strong representation for the good of Surigao del Sur and for the good of the province.Before I end, I would like to promise you I really believe on the presentations made by the Governor that is pro-people, pro  usa kini ka mga maayo kaayo nga presentation nga akong nakita and I promise you, I promise District I, ang among partnership ni Governor magapabilin kini nga partnership ug ang tanan kinahanglan suporta sa provincial government I will extend it to them because I know that is is always in the good hands of a good leader.So, salamat ug salamat sa inyong pagsalig kanamo ug sa giingon na ni Governor we are not Congressman and Governor of Hugpong but we are Governor and Congressman of the Province of Surigao del Sur.Maayong buntag kaninyong tanan.
